The Viterbi algorithm is named after Andrew Viterbi, who proposed it in 1967 as a decoding algorithm for convolutional codes over noisy digital communication links. It has, however, a history of multiple invention, with at least seven independent discoveries, including those by Viterbi, Needleman and Wunsch, and Wagner and Fischer. He is currently Presidential Chair Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California's Viterbi School of Engineering, which was named in his honor in 2004 in recognition of his $52 million gift. </li>

<li>The <b>Rosetta Stone</b> is a granodiorite stele inscribed with a decree issued at Memphis, Egypt, in 196 BC on behalf of King Ptolemy V. The decree appears in three scripts: the upper text is Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, the middle portion Demotic script, and the lowest Ancient Greek. Because it presents essentially the same text in all three scripts (with some minor differences among them), it provided the <b>key</b> to the modern understanding of <b>Egyptian hieroglyphs</b>.</li>

Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called moai, created by the early Rapa Nui people. The introduction of the Polynesian rat and overpopulation led to gradual deforestation and extinction of natural resources, which caused the demise of the Rapa Nui civilization (111 people in 1877).</li>

<li>WER(Word Error Rate) is the metric of speech language detection.</li>
<li>Bayes Net uses DAG (it's more about causation and difficult to produce) and Markov Net uses undirected graph (it's more about correlation and easier to make).</li>
<li>Discriminative models are mainly trained on undirected graph because it results in convex optimization problem whereas if it is applied to directed graph it becomes non-convex optimization problem.</li>
