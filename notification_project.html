<h2>Title</h2>
<b>Assessing Notification Importance to Schedule Notifications on Mobile Devices</b>
<hr>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<hr>
<p>In this always-connected world, we receive a large number of notifications delivering a variety of updates, messages and alerts on our mobile devices. This issue of notification overload becomes more pressing when apps are also actively(e.g. Google Now) churning out push notifications to grab our attention. These notifications cause disruption to users, impact their lifestyle, and may even cause stress due to the high expectation of immediate response in case of instant messengers. Through our initial experiments, we have found out that 30%  to 70%  of the notifications remain unseen by the users. In this circumstances, we argue that importance of the notifications is a central factor in managing these on smartphones. We observe that the different responses to a notification can be a good indicator of its relevance. Furthermore, this responsiveness to notification can help in devising strategy for proper utilization of precious user attention.

<h2>Goal</h2>
<hr>
<p>We want to build a smarter notification manager which will notify users only when it is needed. For this, we are conducting a two phase study (IRB approved : <b>Study No 2015-09-0033</b>, <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swadhin/Notification/Approval_Letter.pdf">Approval Letter</a>)  through android apps : Notifbase app and Snotify app. In first app, we will understand the notification pattern and usage and the second app will be a notification manager based on the previous insights.

<h2>Award</h2>
<p>Each participant will receive <b>$25</b> worth of Amazon Gift card if he/she keeps the apps for at least <b>21 days</b>. Participants are also required to provide their email ID, IMEI no, Age, and Gender information. Participants may also be required to fill out a survey regarding the experience or suggestions. Participants are also required to sign the consent form (<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swadhin/Notification/Consent_Form.pdf">Consent Form</a>) as per UTAustin's IRB regulation. Any interested person can download, print, sign, scan, and send the copy to the below given mail ID.

<h2>Notifbase App</h2>
<hr>
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swadhin/Notification/Notifbase.apk">App Link</a>.
<p>This is an Android app which collects notification related data, and a few sensor/location related data (opportunistically) to understand the notification pattern and user behavior (The detail of the collected data in this document: <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swadhin/Notification/Notifbase.pdf">Link</a>). This app needs notification service, accessibility service, and application usage monitor service permission. This app does not have any relevant front-end and it is mainly being developed for research purpose. In this app, users are not required to perform any action.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Snotify App</h2>
<hr>
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~swadhin/Notification/Snotify.apk">App Link</a>.
<p>This is and android app which is basically a notification manager which logs/traps all the notifications and notify users opportunistically. This app also has an interface to get the information from the users regarding notification importance (which will help in our evaluation). This app needs notification service, accessibility service, and application usage monitor service permission. This app has a useful front-end to monitor the notification usage and inbox of all the notifications. In this app, users are required to perform periodic task to provide explicit impportance information of notifications.
